You may need to to it every 4-6 hours to ensure that the urine volume in the bladder does not exceed 400 ml. If you do not do it frequently enough and your bladder becomes overfilled, the risk of urinary tract infections and leakage increases.

The Nelaton app helps you track your hydration levels.
